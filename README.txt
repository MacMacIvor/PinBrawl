IMPORTANT:
Pin-Brawl has some networking built into it that is hardcoded in. This means that it only connects to
certain computers, which means it may not be playable on every computer since it needs to connect to run.
It should work on most computers, but if clicking "New Game" doesn't do anything in the game, that's why.

To play the game, you have to run the server at the same time, which only works locally on one computer.
So, you have to run the server first, and then it will let you play (you can still play single player)
by selecting new game, and choosing a game mode.

Endless is the most developed game mode, the others were there from last semester and have not been updated
too much since.

Shift is to dash, left click is a regular attack, right click is charge attack.
Health is in the top, charge meter for attacks is below it.
